__IO -> volatile GPIO typedefGPIO_BASE here GPIO typedef is one structure for different address GPIOA BASE, GPIOB BASE,..... AHB1ENR , The registers above the ABH1ENR should be used for that we will create a dummy , The registers below the ABH1ENR is no need to use. DELAY -> used to blink RR_TYPEDEF -> using structure you cahnge all the values to address.

GPIO_BASE (AHB1PERIPH_BASE + GPIO_OFFSET) When we use the (volatile unsigned int )then we call as address integer poiter typecaste (RCC_BASE + AHB1EN_R_OFFSET)will be changes as address. ((volatile unsigned int *)(RCC_BASE + AHB1EN_R_OFFSET))
