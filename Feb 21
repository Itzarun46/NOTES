Serval Communication
Parallel Communication
8 bit daba is tranford One bit at a time(serial)
8 bit data is transfered the same time(parallel)

LSB - Least significance bit
MSB - Most Significance bit

Serial data Communication use two methods.
* Synchronous clock is transmitted with data
* Asynchronous no clock transmitted. Transmitter & receiver agree on clock Speed for data transmithion. (Baudrate)

Simplex
Data can be transmitied only an received only.
- one direction only
eg: FM

Half duplex
Data can be transmitted in only one way at a time
Transmitter - Transmitter
Receiver - receiver

Full duplex
Data can be transmitted in both ways.
eg:UART

→In asynchronous transmission, each byte (character) is packed between start and stop bite

In UART-it (stop bit) can be a bit, 1 bit or 1/2 bit

→ Baudrate
connection speed expereused in bets per second

UART
After initialize we will go for Receive or send
