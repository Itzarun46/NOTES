GPIOA base address will be -> 0x40020000 When we know the base address of GPIOA and we know the offset 0x00 then we can know the place.

MODER register base address + offset : 0x00

OTYPER register base address + offset : 0x04

pheripheral base 40020000 offset 20000 base address 40000000 pheripheral base (pheriph base + AHBIperiph_offset) (GPIO_OFFSET = 0x0000UL)
